# Fortune-teller
Makes "randomized" fortunes

Incomplete. Java.

Pseudocode:

Import "random" Java class
Import "scanner" Java class

"Welcome to program, do you want a fortune" y/n input 
// If no, "ok" and exit program
// If yes, continue

x = random number 1-5

if x==1:
string y = "fortune 1"
...
if x ==5:
string y = "fortune 5"

Print ("your fortune is" y)
Exit program

Plan: 
Program creator does everything from x = random number to string y = fortune 5, including writing fortunes
Collaborator 1 does everything else: import statements, y/n input, print fortune, and exit program
